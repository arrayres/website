        High-Frequency Trading

          Generally speaking, HFT is automated trading with carefully crafted
          computer algorithms (strat&shy;egies), specifically tuned to take into
          account market microstructure features of different stock, futures, and
          other exchanges.
        </p>
        <p>
          HFT strategies warrant vigilant testing and tuning. By definition, HFT
          algorithms need to be exe&shy;cuted with extremely low latencies
          (microseconds) utilizing massive datasets consisting of information of
          the state of the order-book (buy and sell orders).
        </p>
        <p>
          HFT is nowadays a hotly debated topic, being accused of manipulations
          (see Michael Lewis, 2014: Flash Boys), but in reality HFT lowers costs
          for investors and provides liquidity to markets (see e.g. Tommi A.
          Vuorenmaa, 2013: "<a class="link--alizarin" href="http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jot.2012.8.1.058">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Automated High-Frequency Trading</a>",
          Journal of Trading, Winter Issue).

          We are looking for enthusiastic Scala (Java/C++ to some extent)
          programmers and web de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ers to complete a new
          High-Frequency Trading (HFT) related project expected to become
          a business venture in the near term. We currently have need for
          order-book data related tasks (ITCH / FIX / possibly other protocols),
          web-interface and server related tasks, and for our back&shy;test&shy;ing
          framework development. Researchers with a PhD, or students in the
          process of doing a PhD, are also encouraged to apply to participate
          in our ongoing scientific projects that have both academic and
          business goals related to HFT.
        </p>

          <li>Strategies assembled from smaller blocks in functional reactive programming style</li>
          <li>An expressive domain specific language enables strategy development for non-Scala users</li>
          <li>Team communication primarily through Github, Trello, Slack, and other electronic media</li>
          <li>Project will have a certain amount of open source code, but it remains mostly proprietary</li>
          <li>We are about to launch a simple prototype that will exemplify the basic ideas of our approach</li>
