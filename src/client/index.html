        High-Frequency Trading
      </h2>

      <div class="text-block">
        <p>
          Generally speaking, HFT is auto&shy;mated trading with carefully crafted
          computer al&shy;go&shy;rithms (strat&shy;egies), specifically tuned to take into
          account market micro&shy;struc&shy;ture features of different stock, futures, and
          other ex&shy;changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          HFT strategies warrant vigilant testing and tuning. By definition, HFT
          al&shy;go&shy;rithms need to be exe&shy;cuted with extremely low latencies
          (microseconds) utilizing massive datasets consisting of information of
          the state of the order-book (buy and sell orders).
        </p>
        <p>
          HFT is nowadays a hotly debated topic, being accused of ma&shy;nipu&shy;la&shy;tions
          (see Michael Lewis, 2014: Flash Boys), but in reality HFT lowers costs
          for investors and provides liquidity to markets (see e.g. Tommi A.
          Vuorenmaa, 2013: "<a class="link--alizarin" href="http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jot.2012.8.1.058">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Automated High-Frequency Trad&shy;ing</a>",
          Journal of Trading, Win&shy;ter Issue).

          We are looking for enthusiastic Scala (Java/C++ to some extent)
          pro&shy;gram&shy;mers and web de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ers to complete a new
          High-Frequency Trading (HFT) related project expected to become
          a busi&shy;ness venture in the near term.
        </p>
        <p>
          We currently have need for
          order-book data related tasks (ITCH / FIX / possibly other protocols),
          web-inter&shy;face and server related tasks, and for our back&shy;test&shy;ing
          frame&shy;work development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers with a PhD, or stu&shy;dents in the
          process of doing a PhD, are also en&shy;cour&shy;aged to apply to participate
          in our ongoing sci&shy;en&shy;tif&shy;ic projects that have both academic and
          business goals re&shy;lated to HFT.
        </p>
        <ul class="todo-list">
          <li>Strategies assembled from smaller blocks in functional reactive pro&shy;gram&shy;ming style</li>

          <li>Team communication pri&shy;mar&shy;ily through Github, Trello, Slack, and other elec&shy;tron&shy;ic media</li>
          <li>Project will have a certain amount of open source code, but it remains mostly pro&shy;pri&shy;etary</li>
          <li>We are about to launch a simple prototype that will exemplify the basic ideas of our approach</li>
